*Thursday Week 3 (19-May-2022)*

I have made a [slideshow version of the Drawing Graphics page]({{< ref "gameDesign/02basics/graphicsSlides.md" >}}), which you may find easier to follow. Read the text, follow the instructions, and attempt the exercises. Make sure you save them all as separate files. Some of you will have already done this, and you can get working on making [interactive things]({{< ref "gameDesign/02basics/arcade" >}}) (or **games**, as we call them).

{{< hint danger >}}
**You can use `Mu Editor` or `Visual Studio Code`.** If using Visual Studio Code, you need to start each program with:
```python
import pgzrun
```
and finish it with
```python
pgzrun.go()
```
If you have trouble with this, use Mu Editor instead.

If you already have Mu installed, still go to the Company Portal and check that you have the most up to date version. If you can press the Install button, there is a newer version.

Note that you had an older version before, you may end up with two copies installed, an old one called Mu, and a new one called Mu Editor. Use the one called Mu Editor.

*Monday Week 9 (28-Mar-2022)*

In our web apps we're going to need to make decisions, so today you'll start working on the next set of checkpoint tasks on [selection]({{< ref "/checkpoint2/selection.md" >}}).

**Take note of the new requirements for how to lay out your file. You still write the same thing as you otherwise would, it's just wrapped up in a strange looking way which makes it easy to mark, without changing how you interact with it.**

You should be finished these tasks by the end of Week 9 (this week), so you have class time today and Thursday to work on them.

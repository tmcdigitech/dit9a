*Thursday Week 5 (2-June-2022)*

In preparation for making your own game, today you should work through [this set](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/5fe69927-10b8-450b-ad7f-7d01ce76d20c) of short videos which will make a simple game from scratch. Your game may adapt and extend this one, or it might be very different, but there will almost certainly be things of use to you.

{{< hint danger >}}
**You can use `Mu Editor` or `Visual Studio Code`.** If using Visual Studio Code, you need to start each program with:
```python
import pgzrun
```
and finish it with
```python
pgzrun.go()
```
If you have trouble with this, use Mu Editor instead.

If you already have Mu installed, still go to the Company Portal and check that you have the most up to date version. If you can press the Install button, there is a newer version.

Note that you had an older version before, you may end up with two copies installed, an old one called Mu, and a new one called Mu Editor. Use the one called Mu Editor.

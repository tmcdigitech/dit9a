*Thursday Week 1 (5-May-2022)*

This term we will be focussing on developing algorithms and more complex programs through game design. We will use Pygame Zero again (as you did last year).

**For this lesson download `Mu Editor` from the `Company Portal`.**

If you already have Mu installed, still go to the Company Portal and check that you have the most up to date version. If you can press the Install button, there is a newer version.

Note that you had an older version before, you may end up with two copies installed, an old one called Mu, and a new one called Mu Editor. Use the one called Mu Editor.

To get your minds back in the game, work through the notes and exercises in the [graphics section]({{< ref "gameDesign/02basics/graphics" >}}). Make sure you do, and save individually, each of the exercises it asks you to do. **You should be able to finish that page in the double lesson. If not, it is homework!**

If you finish ahead of time, begin working on the [arcade section]({{< ref "gameDesign/02basics/arcade" >}}).

13. Lines cheat A naughty pupil has been given lines to copy as a punishment from their Computing teacher. The have been asked to type out “I must not behave like muppet in class” 20 times. Write a program that asks a pupil to enter a sentence. The same sentence should then be displayed 20 times.

To run your file, you should be able to press the play button in the top right of the window. Failing that, from the file explorer on the left, right click on your file and choose Open in Integrated Terminal.</description></item><item><title>bottle.run()</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit10a/glossary/bottleRun/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit10a/glossary/bottleRun/</guid><description>run(reloader=True, debug=True) You can just say run(), and it will begin using a set of defaults, but we have customised the server slightly. The reloader flag tells the server to restart every time we change a code file, which saves us from turning it off and on again every time we modify our code. Very handy for development! The debug flag does a something thing for templates.
There are a lot of other flags you can use, but two that you might find handy are:</description></item><item><title>URLs</title><link>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit10a/glossary/URLs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmcdigitech.github.io/dit10a/glossary/URLs/</guid><description>\[\overbrace{\text{https}}^{\text{scheme}}\text{://} \overbrace{\text{tmcdigitech.github.io}}^{\text{address}} \text{:}\overbrace{\text{8080}}^{\text{port}} \overbrace{\text{/dit10a/glossary/URLs/}}^{\text{path/endpoint}}\] The scheme tells the browser how it will connect to the server. This is typically https, but could also be http, ftp, mailto, or any number of others.
The address tells the browser where to send the request, i.e. which address. Addresses can be in the form of domain names like google.com, or IP addresses like 192.168.0.1.
google.com is like saying Thomas More College.</description></item></channel></rss>

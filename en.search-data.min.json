Cricket over    In cricket a bowler bowls 6 balls at a time. This is called an over. Each ball bowled may be hit by the batter who may score some runs.

Adapt program 11 to repeatedly ask for the next amount of money raised. If the user types a number, that number is added to the total and the program asks again. If the user just presses Enter, with nothing else, the program stops asking and displays the total raised, including the doubled value if appropriate.  Enter the total raised by each person: \u0026gt; 238 \u0026gt; 624 \u0026gt; 546 \u0026gt; 333 \u0026gt; 651 \u0026gt; 174 \u0026gt; A total of $2566 was raised.

No more presents    You have money to spend on your birthday. Write a program that will ask you what you have to spend, and then to enter the price of each present you want until your total reaches or is over the amount you started with. The program should produce the output shown.  How much money did you get? \u0026gt; 200 You have $200. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 35 You have $165. Price of next item: \u0026gt; 100 You have $65.

Each time the user guesses the program informs them if their guess is too high, too low or correct. The guessing game only finishes when the user’s guess matches the unknown number.  I\u0026#39;m thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Which number do you think it is? 45 Your guess is too low. Try again. 86 Your guess is too high. Try again. 67 Your guess is too high.

This is typically https, but could also be http, ftp, mailto, or any number of others.\nThe address tells the browser where to send the request, i.e. which address. Addresses can be in the form of domain names like google.com, or IP addresses like 192.168.0.1.\n google.com is like saying Thomas More College. 192.168.0.1 is like saying 35 Amsterdam Crescent, Salisbury Downs. localhost is a special value which refers to your own machine. If your server is set to listen to localhost it won\u0026rsquo;t be visible to any other computer at all, which is very useful for developing and testing code which is incomplete and potentially buggy.  The path/endpoint tells the browser what to ask the server for, and the server will return the appropriate response based on the path. A path can be as simple as /, or considerably more complicated.\n"}]
